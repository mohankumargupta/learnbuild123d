# Learn Build123d with Jupyter in VSCode

Recently discovered that Build123d comes with Jupyter notebook integration out of the box.

Simply need to:

```sh
pip install build123d notebook
```

In VSCode, you also need python and jupyter extensions installed. The jupyter extension will install an additional dependency
for you (ipykernel)

If you create a virtual environment using vscode, then just use the pyproject.toml from the repo.

The advantage of jupyter notebook is that you can share with others and the notebooks are interactive with the assistance of nbviewer
